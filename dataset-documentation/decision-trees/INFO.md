# Decision trees
This folder provides Python code for the generation of decision-tree images to guide the validation of datasheets using SHACL.

Decision tree graphics are created using `PyGraphviz`.

Dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`, but your system also requires packages related to `graphviz`. It is recommended that this is installed using a Python virtual environment. Running the `install-with-venv.sh` script will luck does all of this for Ubuntu / Debian based systems.
